# gopoly

## Introduction

This library, which complements the polynomial operations missing in Gonum, currently only supports evaluation and multiplication, but that's enough for me. And the library is still being updated. If you have any idea, please contact me, thank you

## Install

1. Just run

````go
go get "github.com/nimocat/gopoly"
````

in your terminal.

2. Enjoy it!
